 	 <p>Hi, thanks for dropping by and welcome to Tephie's Journal. I am not much of a writer, but it is never too late to start. In this blog, you will find my photography from all those trips I have taken, and the ones that have yet to come alive. Also, some reading recommendations for designers and non-designers, lettering explorations and anything else I find inspiring.</p>
